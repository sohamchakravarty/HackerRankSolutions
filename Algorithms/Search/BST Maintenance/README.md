BST Maintenance (140 Points)
===================

Consider a binary search tree T which is initially empty. Also, consider the first N positive integers {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ….., N} and its permutation P {a1, a2, …, aN}.

If we start adding these numbers to the binary search tree T, starting from a1, continuing with a2, … (and so on) …, ending with aN. After every addition we ask you to output the sum of distances between every pair of T’s nodes.

Input Format
The first line of the input consists of the single integer N, the size of the list.
The second line of the input contains N single space separated numbers the permutation a1, a2, …, aN itself.

Constraints 
1 ≤ N ≤ 250000

Output Format
Output N lines.
On the ith line output the sum of distances between every pair of nodes after adding the first i numbers from the permutation to the binary search tree T
